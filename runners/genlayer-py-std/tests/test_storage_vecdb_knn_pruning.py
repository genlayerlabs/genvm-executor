	"""
	Regression test for KNN pruning skipping the true nearest neighbor.

	``knn`` prunes a child subtree when ``child_dist - _max_descendant_dist >
	best_kth_dist``. That bound is only valid for a metric, but the default
	``EuclideanDistanceSquared`` returns *squared* Euclidean distance, which
	does not satisfy the triangle inequality. With the points below the cover
	tree forms a root -> child -> grandchild chain along a single axis; the
	query sits near the grandchild while the child is farther away, so the
	child subtree gets pruned after the root fills the best heap even though
	the grandchild is the actual nearest neighbor.
